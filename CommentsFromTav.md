* I like that the TODO: tag has been used to denote stuff to come back to. I find that FIXME: is useful as well. Just make sure to get back and finish these bullets!

* Not gona go into the code format issues. Tabs spaces, indentations, braces. Needs lots of cleanup.
* More personal preference, but the 80 character limit is for old people who only use vi. If a line of code isn't going to go to far past 80 characters don't worry about splitting it up to stick to the limit.
* JSPs look good at a glance. We will focus on the gui more later tho :)
* Add the target directory to the .gitignore, that should not ever need to be in version control.
